## Do you write about the times you’ll never forget or the ones you’re afraid you won’t remember?
This morning I boarded a train from the very northwest corner of Poland along the Baltic, to the very southeast (about a twelve hour ride). So, as you can imagine, seven hours in, I’ve had quite a bit of time to pause and ponder, and potentially make some progress on a long overdue update. So much has happened in the past 3 months of my adventure in Poland that it’s hard to know where to begin. The big question that crossed my mind - and has likely crossed the mind of every writer, amateur to experienced - was should I write about experiences I’ll never forget or those I’m afraid I will? The latter is clearly a much more practical approach. But then again, I’m not writing to strategize, I’m writing to share... Hence, here are some of the highlights:

  * **[Lessons from life with my 94-year-old roommate, Uncle Wujek](http://www.fineuntitled.com/polska/2018/04/16/life-with-my-94-year-old-roommate.html)**
  * **[Weekend in the Tatra Mountains](http://www.fineuntitled.com/polska/travel/2018/03/25/weekend-in-the-tatras.html)**
  * **I'm officially a coding bootcamp graduate.** It's really incredible how much you can learn in just a few months time. Not only did I up my data viz game through deeper understanding of the JavaScript fundamentals behind D3 -- the data viz library that was generally my go-to -- but I also now have a solid React (JS framework), HTML, and CSS/Sass foundation. The best part though? Being able to take in all the info alongside some truly incredible people. I enjoyed the conversations over lunch, cooking Indian food, and along the Wisla river, as much as those during "official" school hours.
  * **First time by the Baltic.** To be completely honest, I thought walking along the beach for 6+ hours a day, everyday might get a bit boring. It didn't. I have the best mom in the history of the world and my two incredible aunts to thank for that! Nothing makes you feel more like a kid again than ice-cream, ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and jumping through waves (albeit freezing cold waves).

## And now that you know a bit of what was, here's a little of what's next:
  * In about a week I fly to South East Asia for a month of exploring Thailand and Indonesia with one of my best-friends, Rachel. Right now, the plan is Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, and Bali (and nearby islands). **If you have any recommendations, gladly accepting any and all!**
  * And after that? It’d probably be good to find a job… ideally as a **React developer**! I'm having a lot of fun working through the challenges of my latest project, an **app to create an interactive family tree** built using React and D3 (will share the final product later).
    * What side of the Atlantic that job will be located in, is still up in the air for the moment. I think I know which way I’m leaning, but I also know, I have a little while to see if the wind blows me in the other direction. I’ll keep you updated!
  * But before all that, there’s a few more things on my life to-do/"to-learn" list:
    * How to drive a car stick-shift
    * How to bake szarlotka + Polish grammar lessons with Aunt Hania
    * Prep our apple trees/black current bushes for the summer bloom
    * Make my friend and former neighbor, Pierre, a new site so he can share his **[incredible woodworking talent](http://www.pierredavis.net/)** with the world
