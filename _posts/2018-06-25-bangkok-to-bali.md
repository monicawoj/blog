# What can four weeks in South East Asia look like?
## Pretty beautiful, if you ask me.
This past May, my most incredible friend and travel partner, Rachel, and I set off for a month in Thailand and Indonesia. Memories, bug bites, and scuba licenses later, we could not have asked for a better trip.

**[Take a look at the trip summary](https://monicawoj.github.io/bangkok2bali/)** I put together (testing to see if I still remember how to code, post computer-free month!) I've included links to some of our top activities, in case you're headed East yourself!
