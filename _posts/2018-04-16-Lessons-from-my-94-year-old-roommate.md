## What is the key to a long, happy, healthy life?
Muesli (at least according to my 94-year-old uncle). For those that don't know the magic of this oat and grain conncoction, you're missing out. Substance aside, I think my uncle has a very wise approach to his diet: your body is smart; give your body *options* not optimization. In other words, everything in moderation. Butter, bread, salt, sugar - and all the other so-called evils of modern-day cuisine - are allowed a seat at the table. For my uncle, there is no algorithm for maximized good health, just common sense and little humility to let your body make the decisions it was created to make. I think the world today, so focused on being in control of everything from diet and exercise to time and business performance, could use a little more of that humility and trust (but more on that topic later).


But in all seriousness, it's not what we eat, it's who we eat it with. My hands-down favorite part of my (so-far) two+ months in Poland has been living with my great-uncle. There's just something so simple and yet so special about
## It's not what you eat, it's who you eat it with. My uncle's been married to my aunt for over almost seventy years.
eats lots of fat + sugar, so refreshing in today's health super-conscious world


## interested with life / knows the latest that's going on..
## always come home to new snipits to read
## refreshing conversations - and breaking stereotypes (going to sleep late, political leanings, etc.)

There's been a ton of adventure over the past two months, lots of learning, but it's safe to say that spending time with my uncle has been the greatest gift.
Why? We care for each other. can take care of someone, someone that likes me because I am, not because I am someone or something.
